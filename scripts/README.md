# PDAL Java publish scripts

This is a set of not well maintained scripts that were used to publish PDAL from a Mac laptop. 
Crosscompilation idea in this case is to build linux binaries in a docker conatiner, mac binaries locally, pack all the outputs into the jar.

Similar result is achieved via CI at this point.
