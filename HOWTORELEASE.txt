This document describes the process for releasing a new version of PDAL JNI bindings.

General Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Process

1) Publish JNI Bindings
    What you need:
        - an account on sonatype (https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa)
        - ~/.sbt/1.0/sonatype.sbt file with the following content:
            credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
                           "oss.sonatype.org",
                           "<your username>",
                           "<your password>")

    The description of the Sonatype publishment process (everything described below is in a java dir: cd PDAL/java):
        - Publishing snaphots:
            Snapshot can be published without PGP sign, it is published to a snapshot repo and allows immediate snaphot updates.
            To publish everything in a local repo use command:
              - ./scripts/publish-local.sh (publishes scala 2.11 version)
              - ./scripts/publish-local-212.sh (publishes scala 2.12 version)
              - ./scripts/publish-local-native.sh (publishes native dependencies)
            To publish everything into sonatype snapshot repo use:
              - ./scripts/publish-all.sh
            Summary:
              - Run ./scripts/publish-all.sh and everything is available in a snaphost repository
        - Publishing releases:
            To publish everything into sonatype snapshot repo (staging repo) use:
              - ./scripts/publish-all.sh --suffix="" --signed
               `suffix` defines version suffix (for example `--suffix="-RC1"`)
               `signed` means that jar would be uploaded into a staging sonatype repo with a PGP sign
            Staging means a special repository in a pre released condition.
              - Go into staging repos panel: https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories (log in using sonatype user / pwd)
              - Filter by package name (pdal in our case) and select staging repo
              - Press Close button on the top of the table with repos. It would run packages
                validation and will close staging repo in a succesfull case
              - After succesfull closing press Release button. It would be immediately published into sonatype releases repo,
                and synced with maven central ~ in 10 minutes and ~ in 2 hours it would be indexed here:
                http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cio.pdal

            Deploying to sonatype using sbt official doc: http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Using-Sonatype.html
            Official sonatype guide with pics of (https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories) and answers the question what
            to do after jars were published into a staging repo (in our case after ./scripts/publish-all.sh --suffix="" --signed step)
            Summary:
              - Run ./scripts/publish-all.sh --suffix="" --signed to publish everything into staging repo
              - Go to sonatype panel https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories and release the jar
              - Await ~10 minutes to have jars published to maven central
